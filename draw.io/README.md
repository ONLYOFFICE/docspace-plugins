## Overview

Create, edit, and insert professional-looking diagrams.

## How to configure

To start working with the plugin, it is not needed to change the default settings.

In case you want to adjust the plugin settings, go to *Settings -> Developer Tools -> Plugins* and click on the gear symbol next to the draw.io plugin.

## How to use

**Creating a new diagram**

* The plugin is available via the *Action button -> More* in the My documents section or in the selected room.
* When you click on the draw.io icon, a pop-up window appears where you can change/enter the file name.
* A new *.drawio* file appears in the file list.

To open the created diagram, click on the file name or do it via the *file context menu -> Actions -> Edit diagram*. The file will open in the same tab. To get back to the file list, click "Save&Exit" or "Exit".

If a diagram is opened by a user with the view rights, only the Exit button is available. Any changes made by this user will not be saved.

**Editing an exported diagram**

draw.io diagrams can be exported as images. Such images can be re-opened and edited using the plugin.
