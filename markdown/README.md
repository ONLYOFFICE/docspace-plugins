## Overview

View, create and edit .md files.

## How to configure

To start working with the plugin, it is not needed to change the default settings.

In case you want to adjust the plugin settings, go to *Settings -> Integration -> Plugins* and click on the gear symbol next to the Markdown plugin.

## How to use

**Creating a new .md file**

* The plugin is available via the *Action button -> More* in the My documents section or in the selected room.
* When you click *Create markdown*, a pop-up window appears where you can change/enter the file name.
* A new .md file appears in the file list.

To open the created .md file, click on the file name or do it via the *file context menu -> Actions -> Edit markdown / Preview markdown.* The file will open in the same tab. 

To get back to the file list:

* If the file is opened for editing: click *Save&Close* or сlick on the cross to the right of the editing window. If you try to close a file with unsaved changes, a warning will appear.
* If the file is opened for viewing: сlick on the cross to the right of the view window.

**Editing .md files**

To edit the file, you need to add markup text to the Markdown section. The entered text will appear in the right Preview section.

To expand the Markdown/Preview section, you can use the corresponding buttons. 

When opening a file for viewing, there is no option to expand the Preview section, since it immediately opens in an expanded form.
